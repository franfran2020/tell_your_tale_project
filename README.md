# Tell Your Tale

Tell Your Tale is a decentralized online story-telling platform that links authors from all over the world with readers who might be interested in their works while also giving authors the chance to make money from their stories and possibly get noticed by a big name in the film industry for a potential film, television series, anime, or cartoon adaptation.

# What is "Tell Your Tale" Really About?

# 1. Opportunities for Authors to Make Money

Through tell your tale, authors can receive rewards for their originality for each chapter. Creating the best physical books or worrying about attracting users from all over the world are no longer requirements for authors. Users from all over the world can mint a single author's tale, and the author receives all proceeds from the sale of each chapter without any restrictions or middlemen. This implies that, even if only 20 users from all over the world are interested in your tale, you can still earn the amount you set for a chapter of your tale from those 20 users without having to meet a minimum number of users.

# 2. Potential story adaption from well-known figures in the business

If an author's tale is so amazing and attracting a lot of user attention, the author has now developed a fan base who demand only the best material for each new tale release. This not only means that the author now receives a tidy sum per chapter from all of his readers, but it also makes it possible for well-known corporations or organizations that make movies, cartoons, or anime to choose a story that interests them, work with the author to bring it to life, and so on. The acquisition of a story by Crunchyroll for a potential anime adaptation or by Warner Bros. or Walt Disney for a film or animated feature would be appropriate examples of this. Unlimited Possibilities!

# 3.Decentralized Tale Storage And Encryption

## Storage

Authors' tales are stored on the decentralized IPFS storage infrastructure rather than a centralized server someplace under the control of a single entity. As a result, the author need not worry if a single node hosting his tale goes offline because other nodes may still be retaining copies of it. Additionally, it provides the artist with the assurance that his story will be saved without requiring him to carry a copy with him at all times, as well as easy access to the story for people all over the world.

## Encryption

Since the user stories are kept on IPFS, a global public storage network, they can be accessed by anybody. So how can the author protect the content of the story from readers who aren't paying for access? Here, we employ threshold cryptography and decentralized encryption through the LIT protocol, making care to encrypt your story before posting it on IPFS and limiting access to the chapter's content to people who have minted it.

# Possible Improvements

The following improvements weren't made because of lack of time for the hackathon.

- Support for image encryption
- Better Formatting for tales
- Allowing Authors withdraw from the client
- More Flexibility when selecting genres
